Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests by Steve Freeman, Nat Pryce Object Mother ObjectMother - Easing Test Object Creation in XP The post contains text snippets from books.\nLet’s define ‘fixture’ The test fixture is everything we need to have to set up in order to exercise the SUT. It includes at least an instance of the class whose method we are testing. We call everything we need in place to exercise the SUT the test fixture, and we call the part of the test logic that we execute to set it up the fixture setup phase of the test. The “test fixture”—or just “fixture”— means “the pre-conditions of the test”.\nFixture types Let me briefly introduce the other types of fixtures. From the persistence perspective:\nFresh Fixture - Each test constructs its own brand-new test fixture for its own private use. Fresh Persistent Fixture - Each test persist the fixture but at the end tears it down Shared Fixture - We reuse the same instance of the test fixture across many tests. It is a persisted fixture From the design perspective:\nMinimal Fixture - We use the smallest and simplest fixture possible for each test Standard Fixture - We reuse the design of the text fixture across the many tests. The Test Smell In my opinion, General fixture test code smell can make developers life complicated and has a big impact on the maintenance of the code in the long run. The project will end-up in situation when the tests are wrote with a lot of straggle or even wrote for coverage and sonar. Let me try to explain why…\nIt is also known as Standard Fixture. It is related to many other smells and causes like:\nObscure Tests - It is difficult to understand the test at a glance Irrelevant Information - Often occurs in conjunction with Hard-Coded Test Data or a General Fixture but can also arise because we make visible all data the test needs to execute rather than focusing on the data the test needs to be understood. Mystery Guest - The test reader is not able to see the cause and effect between fixture and verification logic because part of it is done outside the Test Method. When either the fixture setup or the result verification part of a test depends on information that is not visible within the test and the test reader finds it difficult to understand the behavior that is being verified without first finding and inspecting the external information, we have a Mystery Guest on our hands. Fragile Fixture - When a Standard Fixture is modified to accommodate a new test, several other tests fail. Fragile Test - A test fails to compile or run when the SUT is changed in ways that do not affect the part the test is exercising. Data Sensitivity - If the data changes, the tests may fail unless great effort has been expended to make them insensitive to the data being used. Context Sensitivity - The behavior of the system may be affected by the state of things outside (e.g system clock) Slow Tests - Tests are consistently slow because each test builds the same over-engineered fixture Many more.. I came across General fixture in combination with the Object Mother at a client. Here is an obfuscated example of code, the complete method is real.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 package project.space.earth.feature1; public class TestClass1 { @Test void test1() { Foo expected = FooMother.complete(); //general/standard fixture Foo inputFoo = completeFooWithoutIds(); //local fixture out of general/standard fixture given(service.createFoo(inputFoo)).willReturn(expected); //stub Foo actual = sut.insert(inputFoo); //exercise assertThat(actual).usingRecursiveComparison(recursiveComparisonConfiguration).isEqualTo(expected); //verify } private static Foo completeFooWithoutIds() { Bar bar = BarMother.complete().toBuilder().id(null).childId(null).build(); Tee tee = TeeMother.completeBuilder().id(null).field1(null).bars(List.of(bar)).build(); return FooMother.completeBuilder().id(null).field1(null).createdBy(null).createdDate(null).lastModifiedBy(null).lastModifiedDate(null).tee(tee).build(); } } package project.space.in.another.part.of.solar.system.feature2; public class TestClass2 { @Test void test2() { Object object = new Object(); Object anObject = new Object(); Foo existingFoo = FooMother.complete(); //general fixture Bad bar = BarMother.complete().toBuilder().objectList(List.of(object)).build(); //local fixture out of general/standard fixture given(dependency.action(any(), any())).willReturn(anObject);//stub final Foo actual = sut.action(existingFoo, bar); //exercise final Foo expected = existingFoo.toBuilder().object(object).build(); //local fixture out of general/standard fixture assertThat(actual).usingRecursiveComparison(recursiveComparisonConfiguration).isEqualTo(expected); //verify } } package project.space.next.to.jupiter.feature3; public class TestClass3 { //the same situation } package project.space.somewhere.next.to.the.moon.feature4; public class TestClass4 { //the same situation } The complete() method creates an object with all the fields populated as a standard fixture. It is used in 90% of the use cases that we have in our application. The next day, a bug is discovered in one of those use cases that is caused by the general fixture. We change the complete(), and we get out tests failing and other non-related 50 tests also failed. The complete().toBuilder() is available to override default values but then we have to learn and understand the object state to exclude in the current test.\nI think you see the Mystery Guest here, it’s hard to understand what is being built. There are no clues about the object’s properties state and as a reader you have to jump outside the test context and learn the mystery object.\n.id(null).field1(null).createdBy(null).createdDate(null).lastModifiedBy(null).lastModifiedDate(null)\nThis clearly means the Standard Fixture_ is not what you want. You build way too much for your test, and you are forced to nullify/revert some standard actions on the object.\nLet’s stop here, even tho we can discuss a lot on the code above.\nRoot causes \u0026 theory Fixture Strategy Management It all comes from the test fixture management strategy that has a large impact on the execution time and robustness of the tests. The effects of picking the wrong strategy won’t be felt immediately because it takes at least a few hundred tests before the Slow Tests smell becomes evident and probably several months of development before the High Test Maintenance Cost smell starts to emerge.\nSymptoms The symptom is that each of the failed test builds a larger fixture than it should be. Each failed test builds much more that it would appear to be necessary in that test. It is also hard to understand the relationship between the fixture, the SUT and the expected result. We try to create a standard fixture that solves all the current and future use uses of the application. The more diverse the needs of those tests, the more likely we will end up in a General Fixture. In a sense, Standard Fixture is the result of Big Design Upfront of the test fixture for a whole suite of tests.\nImpact This pattern results in a large fixture that grows over time, and it is difficult to understand. It is difficult to understand how each test uses the fixture. The complexity of the fixture violates the Tests as Documentation goal. It can also cause a Fragile Fixture/Fragile Test as people continue to alter the fixture so that it can handle new tests. It can also enable Slow Tests because a larger fixture takes more time to build, especially if a file system of a database gets in the scene.\nMartin Fowler’s vision quoted by Gerard When I was reviewing an early draft of this book with Series Editor Martin Fowler, he asked me, “Do people actually do this?” This question exemplifies the philosophical divide of fixture design. Coming from an agile background, Martin lets each test pull a fixture into existence. If several tests happen to need the same fixture, then it makes sense to factor it out into the setUp method and split the class into one Testcase Class per Fixture*. It doesn’t even occur to Martin to design a Standard Fixture that all tests can use. So who uses them?\nIn the xUnit community, use of a Standard Fixture simply to avoid designing a Minimal Fixture for each test is considered undesirable and has been given the name General Fixture.\nTestcase Class per what? - Fixture Strategy Management How do we organize our Test Methods onto Testcase Classes? There are a couple of ways to organize tests. This will change over the life of our project. A method is part of a Testcase Class. Should we put all our Test Methods onto a single Testcase Class for the application? Or should we create a Testcase Class for each Test Method? Of course, the right answer lies somewhere between these two extremes, and it will change over the life of our project.\nTestcase Class per Class Testcase Class per Feature Testcase Class per Fixture Testcase Super class Test Helper Testcase Class per Class We put all the Test Methods for one SUT class onto a single Testcase Class When we write our first few Test Methods, we can put them all onto a single Testcase Class. As the number of Test Methods increases, we will likely want to split the Testcase Class so that one Testcase Class per Class is tested, which reduces the number of Test Methods per class . As those Testcase Classes get too big, we usually split the classes further(do we?). In that case, we need to decide which Test Methods to include in each Testcase Class.\nTestcase Class per Feature We group the Test Methods onto Testcase Classes based on which testable feature of the SUT they exercise. As the number of Test Methods increases, we must decide which Testcase Class to assign each Test Method, impacting our ability to grasp the overall test structure. It also influences our fixture setup approach. Using a Testcase Class per Feature allows us to divide a large Testcase Class into smaller ones systematically, without modifying the Test Methods.\nThis approach is suitable when we have a substantial number of Test Methods and want to emphasize the specification of each SUT feature. However, it doesn’t simplify or enhance the understanding of individual Test Methods; only Testcase Class per Fixture accomplishes that. Additionally, if each SUT feature only requires one or two tests, it’s more practical to stick with a single Testcase Class per Class. Note that having a large number of features on a class is a “smell” indicating the possibility that the class might have too many responsibilities.\nTestcase Class per Fixture We organize Test Methods into Testcase Classes based on commonality of the test fixture. An alternative perspective suggests grouping Test Methods that share the same test fixture into one Testcase Class per Fixture. This allows for centralized fixture setup code in the setUp method, but may scatter test conditions across multiple Testcase Classes.\nOrganizing Test Methods based on the required test fixture simplifies individual tests by utilizing Implicit Setup. The Testcase Class per Fixture pattern is suitable when multiple Test Methods need an identical fixture and emphasizes simplicity. However, if each test requires a unique fixture, this pattern becomes less practical, resulting in numerous single-test classes. In such cases, Testcase Class per Feature or Testcase Class per Class may be more appropriate.\nAn advantage of Testcase Class per Fixture is its ability to easily identify if all operations from each starting state are being tested. This pattern aids in discovering Missing Unit Tests prior to production, especially when viewing an outline or method browser in an IDE.\nTestcase Class per Fixture aligns with behavior-driven development and promotes concise test methods with a focus on a single assertion. Combined with descriptive test method names, this pattern facilitates tests serving as documentation. A side effect is an increased number of Testcase Classes, which can be grouped using nested folders, packages, or namespaces dedicated to these test classes.\nTestcase Super class We group the Test Methods onto Testcase Classes based on which testable feature of the SUT they exercise. When encountering the need for repeated logic in multiple tests, we can address it by utilizing Test Utility Methods. The question then arises: Where should these Test Utility Methods be placed?\nOne option is to use a Testcase Superclass as a centralized location for Test Utility Methods. By subclassing this Testcase Superclass, we can reuse the utility methods across multiple Testcase Classes. This approach assumes that our programming language supports inheritance, there are no conflicting uses of inheritance, and the Test Utility Method does not require access to specific types that are not visible from the Testcase Superclass. The same tells us Kent Beck in his chapter “Fixture”.\nEach new kind of fixture should be a new subclass of TestCase.\nTest Helper We define a helper class to hold any Test Utility Methods we want to reuse in several tests. We can use a Test Helper if we wish to share logic or variables between several Testcase Classes and cannot (or choose not to) find or define a Testcase Superclass from which we might otherwise subclass all tests that require this logic.\nThe decision between Testcase Superclass and Test Helper all comes down to type visibility. The client classes need to be able to see the Test Utility Method and the Test Utility Method needs to be able to see all the types and classes it depends on. When it doesn’t depend on many types or when everything it depends on is visible from a single place, like a DTO in a package on the boundary of the application, the Test Utility Method can be put into a common Testcase Superclass we define for that controller. If it depends on types/classes that cannot be seen from a single place that all the clients can see, it may be necessary to put it on a Test Helper in the appropriate test package or subsystem.\nVariation: Object Mother The xUnit book mentions multiple variations of the Test Helper. But I’d like to pay attention a bit to the variation: Object Mother. In my opinion, this particular topic is tricky. Gerard Meszaros says:\nThe Object Mother pattern is simply an aggregate of several other patterns, each of which makes a small but significant contribution to making the test fixture easier to manage. The Object Mother consists of one or more Test Helpers that provide Creation Methods and Attachment Methods , which our tests then use to create ready-to-use test fixture objects. Object Mothers often provide several Creation Methods that create instances of the same class, where each method results in a test object in a different starting state. Because there is no single, crisp definition of what someone means by “Object Mother,” it is advisable to refer to the individual patterns when referring to specific capabilities of the Object Mother.\nMartin says (https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html):\nThe first move is to create fixture in the setup method of an xunit test - that way it can be reused in multiple tests. But the trouble with this is often you need similar data in multiple test classes. At this point it makes sense to have a factory object that can return standard fixtures.\nHere “stardard fixture” contradicts the “reuse the design of the text fixture across the many tests” from xUnit. But then Martin acknowledges that Object Mother will couple your code to the standard fixture.\nObject Mothers do have their faults. In particular there’s a heavy coupling in that many tests will depend on the exact data in the mothers. As a result it’s tricky should you want to change that standard data for any reason.\nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.18.4710\u0026rep=rep1\u0026type=pdf\nThe purpose of the pattern is to generate business objects that resemble as closely as possible actual objects that will exist in production.\nIn my opinion, Object Mother is the last resort of creation an object in a valid state. It should create the object in a minimal valid state for the test. I see some disadvantages in Object Mother pattern:\nEach time developers want a new different variation of data, a new factory method is created, making the Object Mother big and hard to learn. Sometimes developers use the creation methods to create on object for all use cases like ObjectMother.complete() or ObjectMother.someObject(). This return the object with all the fields populated, but it is unclear in what state objects are created without diving in the external class. Thus these methods end up being used across the code base. In an active development, the model changes over a day as well as Mother Objects. Thus, we would have to maintain additional classes and the correctness of the business objects created. As the original paper says, we would have potentially to sign off the real objects with the analysts, if we have this luxury. Because of this, on one of our projects, we actually had developers pairing with analysts in order to ensure that the objects being generated by the pattern were as close as possible to the real thing.\nLooking the ObjectMother - Easing Test Object Creation in XP authors work with plain POJOs, default constructors, setters and getter. While the process of creating an object can indeed be extracted in factory methods, attachment methods, in my opinion, and some pieces of code could be part of the constructor with required arguments, as well as attachment methods may be replaced with rich domain model vs anemic model. An alternative to Object Mother maybe be the Test Data Builders idea from Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Test Choosing a Test Method Organization Strategy Clearly, there is no single best practice we can always follow. The best practice is the one that is most appropriate for the particular circumstance.\nTestcase Class by Class is very popular and the default way of grouping tests. When we have a lot of Mockito stubs in each test method, and it grows, and we tend to copy/paste the stubs in each test, any you cannot push them on the class level because you will start guessing which is used when, its clear that something is not good, we have multiple fixtures in one class, we have to take action.\nTestcase Class per Fixture is commonly used when we are writing unit tests for stateful objects and each method needs to be tested in each state of the object.\nTestcase Class per Feature is more appropriate when we are writing customer tests against a Service Facade; It enables us to keep all the tests for a customer-recognizable feature together. When each test needs a slightly different fixture, the right answer may be to select the Testcase Class per Feature pattern.\nMy conclusion A commonly accepted practice is the use of Implicit Setup in conjunction with Testcase Class per Fixture. This approach is suitable when only a few Test Methods share the same fixture design because they require the same setup. In such cases, utilizing a Minimal Fixture can be advantageous to avoid the unnecessary overhead associated with creating objects that are only needed in other tests.\nA Minimal Fixture focuses on using the smallest and simplest fixture possible for each test. By keeping the fixture small and simple, tests become easier to understand compared to fixtures that include unnecessary or irrelevant information. The concept of a Minimal Fixture plays a crucial role in achieving Test as Documentation. To determine if an object is necessary as part of the fixture, one can try removing it. If the test fails as a result, it indicates that the object was likely necessary in some way.\nI would start with a Minimal Fixture in my tests. At the first iteration, I will set up Testcase per Class. Then, if it grows, multiple Mockito.given().thenReturn() (mock mock mock 🦆) and different stubbing occur in each test, I will refactor test code base into Testcase per Fixture.\nHaving the Testcase per Fixture, I will share common utility methods in an Testcase Super class shared across the classes of that use case. If the use case has negative flows, I would move some common methods in the super class apply.\nI can share the ObjectMother but not as a global static method. It should be either package private limited to the suite of tests. ObjectMother should have proper method names as in paper. You should be able to combine different objects with different attachment methods.\nFor object creation, I consider the constructors with required arguments. If the object state grows and differs, and the telescopic constructors emerge, then I will use builder pattern with internal validations in build().\nI would think twice if I have to extract it in a Test Helper aka Object Mother. I rekon there is code duplication, “But there are different kinds of duplication”. There is an idea from “Clean Architecture” from Uncle Bob I kinda like:\nThen there is false or accidental duplication. If two apparently duplicated sections of code evolve along different paths—if they change at different rates, and for different reasons—then they are not true duplicates. Now imagine two use cases that have very similar screen structures. The architects will likely be strongly tempted to share the code for that structure. But should they? Is that true duplication? Or it is accidental?\nWe are at the cross roads if we have to share the same data structure and state or not. We either might fall into a standard/general fixture setup for 2 use cases, or we have code duplication in both use cases. Choose wisely..\nHow i’d have it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 package project.space.earth.feature1; public class TestClass1 { //Here we can use social tests, test containers if this is backed by database. @Test void test1() { Foo stub = Foo.builder().id().build(); given(service.createFoo(any())).willReturn(stub); //stub Foo inputFoo = newFooComposition(); //minimal fixture Foo actual = sut.insert(inputFoo); //exercise //assertThat(actual).usingRecursiveComparison(recursiveComparisonConfiguration).isEqualTo(stub); //verify //In this line we assert multiple things: //1.

It includes at least an instance of the class whose method we are testing. We call everything we need in place to exercise the SUT the <strong>test fixture</strong>, and we call the part of the test logic that we execute to set it up the <strong>fixture setup</strong> phase of the test.

own <strong>private</strong> use.</li><li><em>Fresh Persistent Fixture</em> - Each test persist the fixture but at the end tears it down</li><li><em>Shared Fixture</em> - We reuse the same instance of the test fixture across many tests. It is a persisted fixture</li></ul><p>From the design perspective:</p><ul><li><em>Minimal Fixture</em> - We use the smallest and simplest fixture possible for each test</li><li><em>Standard Fixture</em> - We reuse the design of the text fixture across the many tests.</li></ul><h2 id=the-test-smell>The Test Smell<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-test-smell>#</a></h2><p>In my opinion, <em>General fixture</em> test code smell can make developers life complicated and has a big impact on the maintenance of the code in the long run. The project will end-up in situation when the tests are wrote with a lot of straggle or even wrote for coverage and sonar. Let me try to explain why&mldr;</p><p>It is also known as <em>Standard Fixture</em>. It is related to many other smells and causes like:</p><ul><li><em>Obscure Tests</em> - It is difficult to understand the test at a glance<ul><li><em>Irrelevant Information</em> - Often occurs in conjunction with <em>Hard-Coded Test Data</em> or a <em>General Fixture</em> but can also arise because we make visible all data the test needs to execute rather than focusing on the data the test needs to be understood.</li><li><em>Mystery Guest</em> - The test reader is not able to see the cause and effect between fixture and verification logic because part of it is done outside the <em>Test Method</em>. When either the fixture setup or the result verification part of a test depends on information that is not visible within the test and the test reader finds it difficult to understand the behavior that is being verified without first finding and inspecting the external information, we have a <em>Mystery Guest</em> on our hands.</li></ul></li><li><em>Fragile Fixture</em> - When a <em>Standard Fixture</em> is modified to accommodate a new test, several other tests fail.</li><li><em>Fragile Test</em> - A test fails to compile or run when the SUT is changed in ways that do not affect the part the test is exercising.</li><li><em>Data Sensitivity</em> - If the data changes, the tests may fail unless great effort has been expended to make them insensitive to the data being used.</li><li><em>Context Sensitivity</em> - The behavior of the system may be affected by the state of things outside (e.g system clock)</li><li><em>Slow Tests</em> - Tests are consistently slow because each test builds the same over-engineered fixture</li><li>Many more..</li></ul><p><img loading=lazy src=images/general-fixture.png alt=general-fixture.png></p><p>I came across <em>General fixture</em> in combination with the <a href=https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html>Object Mother</a> at a client.

The <code>complete().toBuilder()</code> is available to override default values but then we have to learn and understand the object state to exclude in the current test.</p><p>I think you see the <em>Mystery Guest</em> here, it&rsquo;s hard to understand what is being built. There are no clues about the object&rsquo;s properties state and as a reader you have to jump outside the test context and learn the mystery object.</p><p><code>.id(null).field1(null).createdBy(null).createdDate(null).lastModifiedBy(null).lastModifiedDate(null)</code></p><p>This clearly means the Standard Fixture_ is not what you want. You build way too much for your test, and you are forced to nullify/revert some standard actions on the object.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s stop here, even tho we can discuss a lot on the code above.</p><h2 id=root-causes--theory>Root causes & theory<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#root-causes--theory>#</a></h2><h3 id=fixture-strategy-management>Fixture Strategy Management<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fixture-strategy-management>#</a></h3><p>It all comes from the test fixture management strategy that has a large impact on the execution time and robustness of the tests. The effects of picking the wrong strategy won’t be felt immediately because it takes at least a few hundred tests before the <em>Slow Tests</em> smell becomes evident and probably several months of development before the <em>High Test Maintenance Cost</em> smell starts to emerge.</p><h3 id=symptoms>Symptoms<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#symptoms>#</a></h3><p>The symptom is that each of the <strong>failed</strong> test builds a larger fixture than it should be. Each failed test builds much more that it would appear to be necessary in that test. It is also hard to understand the relationship between the fixture, the SUT and the expected result. We try to create a standard fixture that solves all the current and future use uses of the application. The more diverse the needs of those tests, the more likely we will end up in a <em>General
Fixture</em>. In a sense, <em>Standard Fixture</em> is the result of <strong>Big Design Upfront</strong> of the test fixture for a whole suite of tests.</p><h2 id=impact>Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#impact>#</a></h2><p>This pattern results in a large fixture that grows over time, and it is difficult to understand. It is difficult to understand how each test uses the fixture. The complexity of the fixture violates the <em>Tests as Documentation</em> goal. It can also cause a <em>Fragile Fixture</em>/<em>Fragile Test</em> as <strong>people continue to alter the fixture</strong> so that it can handle new tests. It can also enable <em>Slow Tests</em> because a larger fixture takes more time to build, especially if a file system of
a database gets in the scene.</p><h4 id=martin-fowlers-vision-quoted-by-gerard>Martin Fowler&rsquo;s vision quoted by Gerard<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#martin-fowlers-vision-quoted-by-gerard>#</a></h4><blockquote><p>When I was reviewing an early draft of this book with Series Editor Martin Fowler, he asked me, “Do people actually do this?” This question exemplifies the philosophical divide of fixture design. Coming from an agile background, Martin
lets each test pull a fixture into existence. If several tests happen to need the same fixture, then it makes sense to factor it out into the setUp method and split the class into one <strong><em>Testcase Class per Fixture</em></strong>*. It doesn’t even occur to Martin to design a Standard Fixture that all tests can use. So who uses them?</p></blockquote><p>In the xUnit community, use of a <em>Standard Fixture</em> simply to avoid designing a <em>Minimal Fixture</em> for each test is considered <strong>undesirable</strong> and has been given the name General Fixture.</p><h2 id=testcase-class-per-what---fixture-strategy-management>Testcase Class per what? - Fixture Strategy Management<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#testcase-class-per-what---fixture-strategy-management>#</a></h2><h5 id=how-do-we-organize-our-test-methods-onto-testcase-classes>How do we organize our Test Methods onto Testcase Classes?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-do-we-organize-our-test-methods-onto-testcase-classes>#</a></h5><p>There are a couple of ways to organize tests. This will change over the life of our project. A method is part of a <em>Testcase Class</em>. Should we put all our <em>Test Methods</em> onto a single <em>Testcase Class</em> for the application? Or should we create a <em>Testcase Class</em> for each <em>Test Method</em>? Of course, the right answer lies somewhere between these two extremes, and it will change over the life of our project.</p><ul><li>Testcase Class per Class</li><li>Testcase Class per Feature</li><li>Testcase Class per Fixture</li><li>Testcase Super class</li><li>Test Helper</li></ul><h3 id=testcase-class-per-class>Testcase Class per Class<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#testcase-class-per-class>#</a></h3><h5 id=we-put-all-the-test-methods-for-one-sut-class-onto-a-single-testcase-class>We put all the Test Methods for one SUT class onto a single Testcase Class<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#we-put-all-the-test-methods-for-one-sut-class-onto-a-single-testcase-class>#</a></h5><p><img loading=lazy src=images/TestcaseByClass.png alt=TestcaseByClass.png>
When we write our first few <em>Test Methods</em>, we can put them all onto a <strong>single</strong> <em>Testcase Class</em>. As the number of <em>Test Methods</em> increases, we will likely want to split the <em>Testcase Class</em> so that one <em>Testcase Class per Class</em> is tested, which reduces the number of <em>Test Methods</em> per class . As those Testcase Classes get too big, we usually split the classes further(do we?). In that case, we need to decide which Test Methods to include in each Testcase Class.</p><h3 id=testcase-class-per-feature>Testcase Class per Feature<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#testcase-class-per-feature>#</a></h3><h5 id=we-group-the-test-methods-onto-testcase-classes-based-on-which-testable-feature-of-the-sut-they-exercise>We group the Test Methods onto Testcase Classes based on which testable feature of the SUT they exercise.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#we-group-the-test-methods-onto-testcase-classes-based-on-which-testable-feature-of-the-sut-they-exercise>#</a></h5><p><img loading=lazy src=images/TestcaseByFeature.png alt=TestcaseByFeature.png>
As the number of <em>Test Methods</em> increases, we must decide which <em>Testcase Class</em> to assign each <em>Test Method</em>, impacting our ability to grasp the overall test structure. It also influences our fixture setup approach. Using a Testcase Class per Feature allows us to divide a large <em>Testcase Class</em> into smaller ones systematically, without modifying the <em>Test Methods</em>.</p><p>This approach is suitable when we have a substantial number of Test Methods and want to emphasize the specification of each SUT feature. However, it doesn&rsquo;t simplify or enhance the understanding of individual <em>Test Methods</em>; only <em>Testcase Class per Fixture</em> accomplishes that. Additionally, if each SUT feature only requires one or two tests, it&rsquo;s more practical to stick with a single <em>Testcase Class per Class</em>. Note that having a large number of features on a class is a
“smell” indicating the possibility that the class might have too many responsibilities.</p><h3 id=testcase-class-per-fixture>Testcase Class per Fixture<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#testcase-class-per-fixture>#</a></h3><h5 id=we-organize-test-methods-into-testcase-classes-based-on-commonality-of-the-test-fixture>We organize Test Methods into Testcase Classes based on commonality of the test fixture.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#we-organize-test-methods-into-testcase-classes-based-on-commonality-of-the-test-fixture>#</a></h5><p><img loading=lazy src=images/TestcaseByFixture.png alt=TestcaseByFixture.png>
An alternative perspective suggests grouping <em>Test Methods</em> that share the same test fixture into one <em>Testcase Class per Fixture</em>. This allows for centralized fixture setup code in the setUp method, but may scatter test conditions across multiple <em>Testcase Classes</em>.</p><p>Organizing <em>Test Methods</em> based on the required test fixture simplifies individual tests by utilizing Implicit Setup. The <em>Testcase Class per Fixture</em> pattern is suitable when multiple <em>Test Methods</em> need an identical fixture and emphasizes simplicity. However, if each test requires a unique fixture, this pattern becomes less practical, resulting in numerous single-test classes. In such cases, <em>Testcase Class per Feature</em> or <em>Testcase Class per Class</em> may be more appropriate.</p><p>An advantage of <em>Testcase Class per Fixture</em> is its ability to easily identify if all operations from each starting state are being tested. This pattern aids in discovering <em>Missing Unit Tests</em> prior to production, especially when viewing an outline or method browser in an IDE.</p><p><em>Testcase Class per Fixture</em> aligns with behavior-driven development and promotes concise test methods with a focus on a single assertion. Combined with descriptive test method names, this pattern facilitates tests serving as documentation. A side effect is an increased number of <em>Testcase Classes</em>, which can be grouped using nested folders, packages, or namespaces dedicated to these test classes.</p><h3 id=testcase-super-class>Testcase Super class<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#testcase-super-class>#</a></h3><h5 id=we-group-the-test-methods-onto-testcase-classes-based-on-which-testable-feature-of-the-sut-they-exercise-1>We group the Test Methods onto Testcase Classes based on which testable feature of the SUT they exercise.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#we-group-the-test-methods-onto-testcase-classes-based-on-which-testable-feature-of-the-sut-they-exercise-1>#</a></h5><p><img loading=lazy src=images/TestcaseSuperClass.png alt=TestcaseSuperClass.png>
When encountering the need for repeated logic in multiple tests, we can address it by utilizing Test Utility Methods. The question then arises: Where should these Test Utility Methods be placed?</p><p>One option is to use a <em>Testcase Superclass</em> as a centralized location for <em>Test Utility Methods</em>. By subclassing this <em>Testcase Superclass</em>, we can reuse the utility methods across multiple <em>Testcase Classes</em>. This approach assumes that our programming language supports inheritance, there are no conflicting uses of inheritance, and the <em>Test Utility Method</em> does not require access to specific types that are not visible from the <em>Testcase Superclass</em>. The same tells us <em>Kent Beck</em> in his chapter &ldquo;Fixture&rdquo;.</p><blockquote><p>Each new kind of fixture should be a new subclass of TestCase.</p></blockquote><h3 id=test-helper>Test Helper<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#test-helper>#</a></h3><h5 id=we-define-a-helper-class-to-hold-any-test-utility-methods-we-want-to-reuse-in-several-tests>We define a helper class to hold any Test Utility Methods we want to reuse in several tests.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#we-define-a-helper-class-to-hold-any-test-utility-methods-we-want-to-reuse-in-several-tests>#</a></h5><p><img loading=lazy src=images/TestHelper.png alt=TestHelper.png>
We can use a <strong>Test Helper</strong> if we wish to share logic or variables between several <strong>Testcase Classes</strong> and cannot (or choose not to) find or define a <strong>Testcase Superclass</strong> from which we might otherwise subclass all tests that require this logic.</p><p>The decision between <em>Testcase Superclass</em> and <em>Test Helper</em> all comes down to <em>type visibility</em>. The client classes need to be able to see the <em>Test Utility Method</em> and the <em>Test Utility Method</em> needs to be able to see all the types and classes it depends on. When it doesn&rsquo;t depend on many types or when everything it depends on is visible from a single place, like a DTO in a package on the boundary of the application, the <em>Test Utility Method</em> can be put into a common
<em>Testcase Superclass</em> we define for that controller. If it depends on types/classes that cannot be seen from a single place that all the clients can see, it may be necessary to put it on a <em>Test Helper</em> in the appropriate test package or subsystem.</p><h4 id=variation-object-mother>Variation: Object Mother<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#variation-object-mother>#</a></h4><p>The xUnit book mentions multiple variations of the <em>Test Helper</em>. But I&rsquo;d like to pay attention a bit to the variation:
<em>Object Mother</em>.
In my opinion, this particular topic is tricky.
Gerard Meszaros says:</p><blockquote><p>The Object Mother pattern is simply an aggregate of several other patterns, each of which makes a small but
significant contribution to making the test fixture easier to manage. The Object Mother consists of <strong>one or more Test
Helpers</strong> that provide <strong>Creation Methods</strong> and <strong>Attachment Methods</strong> , which our tests then use to create ready-to-use
test fixture objects. Object Mothers often provide several <strong>Creation Methods</strong> that create instances of the same class,
where each method results in a test object in a <strong>different starting state</strong>. Because there is no single, crisp
definition of what someone means by “Object Mother,” it is advisable to refer to the individual patterns when referring
to specific capabilities of the Object Mother.</p></blockquote><p>Martin says (<a href=https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html)>https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html)</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The first move is to create fixture in the setup method of an xunit test - that way it can be reused in multiple
tests. But the trouble with this is often you need similar data in multiple test classes. At this point it makes sense
to have a factory object that can return standard fixtures.</p></blockquote><p>Here &ldquo;stardard fixture&rdquo; contradicts the &ldquo;reuse the design of the text fixture across the many tests&rdquo; from xUnit. But then Martin acknowledges that <em>Object Mother</em> will couple your code to the standard fixture.</p><blockquote><p>Object Mothers do have their faults. In particular there&rsquo;s a heavy coupling in that many tests will depend on the
exact data in the mothers. As a result it&rsquo;s tricky should you want to change that standard data for any reason.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.18.4710&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.18.4710&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a></p><blockquote><p>The purpose of the pattern is to generate business objects that resemble as closely as possible actual objects that
will exist in production.</p></blockquote><p>In my opinion, <em>Object Mother</em> is the last resort of creation an object in a valid state. It should create the object in a minimal valid state for the test.
I see some disadvantages in <em>Object Mother</em> pattern:</p><ul><li>Each time developers want a new different variation of data, a new factory method is created, making the Object Mother big and hard to learn.</li><li>Sometimes developers use the creation methods to create on object for all use cases like <code>ObjectMother.complete()</code> or <code>ObjectMother.someObject()</code>. This return the object with all the fields populated, but it is unclear in what state objects are created without diving in the external class. Thus these methods end up being used across the code base.</li><li>In an active development, the model changes over a day as well as <em>Mother Objects</em>. Thus, we would have to maintain additional classes and the correctness of the business objects created.
As the original <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.18.4710&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper</a> says, we would have
potentially to sign off the real objects with the analysts, if we have this luxury.<ul><li><blockquote><p>Because of this, on one of our projects, we actually had developers pairing with analysts in order to ensure
that the objects being generated by the pattern were as close as possible to the real thing.</p></blockquote></li></ul></li><li>Looking the <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.18.4710&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">ObjectMother - Easing Test Object Creation in XP</a> authors work with plain POJOs, default constructors, setters and getter. While the process of creating an object can indeed be extracted in factory methods, attachment methods, in my opinion, and some pieces of code could be part of the constructor with required arguments, as well as attachment methods may be replaced with <a href=https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html>rich domain model vs anemic model</a>.</li><li>An alternative to <em>Object Mother</em> maybe be the <strong>Test Data Builders</strong> idea from <strong>Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Test</strong></li></ul><h3 id=choosing-a-test-method-organization-strategy>Choosing a Test Method Organization Strategy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#choosing-a-test-method-organization-strategy>#</a></h3><p>Clearly, there is no single <strong>best practice</strong> we can always follow. The best practice is the one that is most appropriate for the particular circumstance.</p><p><em>Testcase Class by Class</em> is very popular and the default way of grouping tests. When we have a lot of <em>Mockito</em> stubs in each test method, and it grows, and we tend to copy/paste the stubs in each test, any you cannot push them on the class level because you will start guessing which is used when, its clear that something is not good, we have multiple fixtures in one class, we have to take action.</p><p><em>Testcase Class per Fixture</em> is commonly used when we are writing unit tests for stateful objects and each method needs to be tested in each state of the object.</p><p><em>Testcase Class per Feature</em> is more appropriate when we are writing customer tests against a Service Facade; It enables us to keep all the tests for a customer-recognizable feature together. When each test needs a slightly different fixture, the right answer may be to select the <em>Testcase Class per Feature</em> pattern.</p><h2 id=my-conclusion>My conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#my-conclusion>#</a></h2><p>A commonly accepted practice is the use of <em>Implicit Setup</em> in conjunction with <strong><em>Testcase Class per Fixture</em></strong>. This approach is suitable when only a few Test Methods share the same fixture design because they require the same setup. In such cases, utilizing a <em>Minimal Fixture</em> can be advantageous to avoid the unnecessary overhead associated with creating objects that are only needed in other tests.</p><p><strong><em>A Minimal Fixture</em> focuses on using the smallest and simplest fixture possible for each test</strong>. By keeping the fixture small and simple, tests become easier to understand compared to fixtures that include unnecessary or irrelevant information. The concept of a <em>Minimal Fixture</em> plays a crucial role in achieving <em>Test as Documentation</em>. To determine if an object is necessary as part of the fixture, one can try removing it. If the test fails as a result, it indicates
that the object was likely necessary in some way.</p><p>I would start with a <em>Minimal Fixture</em> in my tests. At the first iteration, I will set up <em>Testcase per Class</em>. Then, if it grows, multiple <code>Mockito.given().thenReturn()</code> (mock mock mock 🦆) and different stubbing occur in each test, I will <strong>refactor test code base</strong> into <em>Testcase per Fixture</em>.</p><p>Having the <em>Testcase per Fixture</em>, I will share common utility methods in an <em>Testcase Super class</em> shared across the classes of that use case. If the use case has negative flows, I would move some common methods in the super class apply.</p><p>I can share the <em>ObjectMother</em> but not as a global static method. It should be either package private limited to the suite of tests. <em>ObjectMother</em> should have proper method names as in <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.18.4710&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper</a>. You should be able to combine different objects with different attachment methods.</p><p>For object creation, I consider the constructors with required arguments. If the object state grows and differs, and the telescopic constructors emerge, then I will use builder pattern with internal validations in <code>build()</code>.</p><p>I would think twice if I have to extract it in a <em>Test Helper</em> aka <em>Object Mother</em>. I rekon there is code duplication, &ldquo;But there are different kinds of duplication&rdquo;. There is an idea from &ldquo;Clean Architecture&rdquo; from Uncle Bob I kinda like:</p><blockquote><p>Then there is false or accidental duplication. If two apparently duplicated sections of code evolve along different
paths—if they change at different rates, and for different reasons—then they are not true duplicates. Now imagine two
use cases that have very similar screen structures. The architects will likely be strongly tempted to share the code for
that structure. But should they? Is that true duplication? Or it is accidental?</p></blockquote><p>We are at the cross roads if we have to share the same data structure and state or not. We either might fall into a standard/general
fixture setup for 2 use cases, or we have code duplication in both use cases. Choose wisely..</p><p><img loading=lazy src=images/minimal-fixture.png alt=minimal-fixture.png></p><p>How i&rsquo;d have it:</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt id=hl-1-1><a class=lnlinks href=#hl-1-1> 1</a>
